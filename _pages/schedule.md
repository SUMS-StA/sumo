The event will take place on **Saturday 25th March** in University of Glasgow.  

After the main competition, all contestants will be invited for an optional social to provide an opportunity to network and meet likeminded students from other universities. 

It will be free to attend, however teams are expected to organise their own transport to and from Glasgow.
